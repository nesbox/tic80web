    "text": "Note : This cartridge contains a pong game. This game is used as a demonstration of using the game manager. I've added some comment to the game code, so you can check on your own how it works. :)\r\n\r\nNote2 : It's my first LUA program, so i'm sure the code is very ugly, but it work. :) If you have some advices you're welcome.\r\n\r\nIf you want the lib to be included, just copy the two functions gm_init and em_init.\r\nIf you only want the entity manager, you can just copy the em_init.\r\nThe game manager requires the entity manager to work properly.\r\n\r\nIf you copy the managers, it's not an obligation, but i'll appreciate if you mention me (at least in your code). You are free to edit them at will.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe game manager is a small library (coupled with an entity manager) that i've created for simplifying games.\r\n\r\nI've noted that running a game with multiple loops (for example a title screen, then the regular game, an inventory menu ...) can be annoying. Like in the TIC function, when we want to switch between gamestates, this require to write a giant 'if' statement for each game states you have.\r\n\r\nSo I wrote a game manager, and an entity manager :\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Game Manager :\r\nWhen you initialize it, he'll create a 'gm' global variable that contains multiple functions.\r\nWith it, you can register game states and menus.\r\nA game state has a name and a function. A menu is something more complex that i'll explain later.\r\nThe 'gm' has a variable \"currentState\". You'll have to set it to a valid state name so the game manager can run his function.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe menus :\r\nIf you go line 461 to 465, you'll see how menus are registered. the first parameter of newMenu is the name. The second is the menu configuration and the third parameter is a list of items, defined with a label and an action. The action parameter can be a state name (so when the player press A on the item the game manager will switch the gamestate), or a function (that'll be called when the player press A).\r\nActually, you have three types of menu : 'color', 'sprite' and 'indent'. These types will check the 'selection' parameter, and use it for displaying the selected item.\r\n- the 'color' type require that you give a palette color into the 'selection'.\r\n- the 'sprite' type require that you give a sprite name (see the Entity Manager part below) into the 'selection'.\r\n- the 'indent' type require that you give a number of pixels into the 'selection'.\r\n\r\nthere are three more parameters into the newMenu function : a 'back' action, that'll be called when the player press B. This parameter can be a game state or a function. The last two parameters are two 'hook' functions, the first will be called when the player move the cursom and the second when he press A on an item.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Entity Manager :\r\nAt first, i call an entity something that have a sprite, a location and some movement logics. for example the ball you'll see on a pong game is an entity. He have a sprite (the ball), a location (x,y) and a movement logic (he bounces on walls).\r\n\r\nWhen you initialize it, he'll create a 'em' global variable that contains multiple functions.\r\nThis em contains three main parts :\r\n- a sprite manager, you have to define every sprites you want to use, and give them a name\r\n- an entity manager, you'll have to register them with a name, a sprite name, some coordinates and a function that'll be executed for moving one step.\r\n- some colision management : two functions with one more for debug purpose.\r\n\r\nThe colision part contains one function that gives a couple of values that form a box with some useful values if you want to check colisions on you own : x1, y1, x2, y2, width, height, centerX, centerY.\r\nThe second function is a simple colision checking function between two entities that gives you two values : one that says true or false if there is a colision, the other is on which side the colision occured.\r\nThe debug function will display the colision boxes on screen, you can remove it if you want to distribute your cart.\r\n\r\nThe entity manager has two additional functions : one that'll move every entities one step, and one that'll draw one, or all (depending on the parameter) registered entities.\r\n\r\nNote that most functions parameter accept the entity directly, or just his name.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nQuick reference :\r\n\r\nGame Manager\r\ngm_init(default_state)\r\ngm :\r\n  currentState = default_state,\r\n  newMenu(name, config, items, back, func_onChange, func_submit)\r\n  menu(name)\r\n  resetMenu(name)\r\n  newState(state_name, func)\r\n  run()\r\n\r\nEntity Manager\r\nem_init()\r\nem :\r\n  const :\r\n    UP = 1\r\n    DOWN = 2\r\n    LEFT = 4\r\n    RIGHT = 8\r\n  newSprite(id, index, colorkey, scale, flip, rotate, w, h) : sprite\r\n  getSprite(id) : sprite\r\n  hasSprite(id) : boolean\r\n  removeSprite(id)\r\n  newEntity(id, spr_id, x, y, func_move, add_attr) : entity\r\n  getEntity(id) : entity\r\n  hasEntity(id) : boolean\r\n  removeEntity(id)\r\n  checkColision(e1, e2) : {colision, side}\r\n  getBox(e) : {x1, y1, x2, y2, w, h, cx, cy}\r\n  nextMove() \r\n  draw(e)\r\n  debug :\r\n    drawBox(box) "

ATTENTION: Buttons in in-game hints are virtual game-pad buttons, not keyboard buttons, so you can easily play this game on smartphone or controller connected to PC."

Second minimax player explores the search tree more deeply than the first. Second minimax player (angry face) should take a while to compute his moves.\r\nBetter played with between two human players. Putting two angry computers one against the other is not recommended. AI's may take some time to compute their actions (About 6 minutes for hard AI).\r\nThe game's code is a mess but should be well commented enough so that you can understand it. If you want any help understanding it just send me a message on itch.\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n* Arrow keys to move cursor on table and on menus.\r\n* A (z on keyboard) Selects pieces and selects options on menu\r\n* B (x on keyboard) cancels the selection of a piece and leaves in-game menu.\r\n* X (a on keyboard) opens in-game menu\r\nIn-game Menu help:\r\n* Arrow resumes the game\r\n* Select a player's icon to cycle it between human, random AI, Easy Minimax AI and \"Hard\" Minimax AI.\r\n* Select the looping arrow to restart the game.\r\n* Click on the door if you're a heartless person.\r\n\r\nKNOWN BUGS:\r\n* When two AIs are battling it out, the \"AI thinking\" icon shows the faster AI, not the correct one.\r\n\r\nWON'T FIX:\r\n* No audio is intentional. Audio on these kinds of games tended to be what I hated most as a child.\r\n* Cursor points to where the AI moved its piece to help the player identify what move was made.\r\n* I don't plan on adding animations.\r\n\r\nMade by USPM (https://uspm.itch.io/) for the FFS2019 game jam (https://itch.io/jam/finally-finish-something-2019).\r\n\r\nUpload: Basic game, no en-passant, no checking\r\nUpdate#1: Added en-passant and checking.\r\nUpdate#2: Made AI choose moves weighted by whether it captured a piece.\r\nUpdate#3: Added further heuristics to minimax AI's choice.\r\nUpdate#4: Bugfixes.\r\nUpdate#5: Bugfixes, performance improvements, tested which \"hard\" AI was harder, implemented castling.

I have completely rewritten the code from scratch, and added a lot of new features, such as textures, sounds, new blocks and more! Not to mention that the new cart runs much much smoother in comparison. You can check it out here:\r\n- https://tic.computer/play?cart=839\r\n\r\nI (TehShadowz) do not own this game/demo. It was originally posted by Never (https://tic.computer/play?cart=754), but I noticed there were some bugs with the 3D rendering code that caused a fish eye lens effect, so I decided to fix them. I also changed how things get teleported to allow seamless trips between portals, physically realistic vision of what's on the other side, and prevent the player from glitching inside the portals. But regardless, all credit goes to Never.\r\n\r\nMy notes:\r\nIt is not recommended to play this game on the browser, as performance and quality might not be that great. (Although Never has done a brilliant job by creating an automatic quality settings system, it doesn't completely solve the problem). Surf using your downloaded version of TIC-80 or save this cartridge to your devide in order to play and get a decent experience out of it ;)\r\nOriginal description by Never:\r\n\r\nwell yes\r\nit's portals in raycasting\r\nNOTE:\r\nYou can't place portals on all walls, only on light ones.\r\nQuality will automatically change if FPS is low.\r\n\r\nUP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT - move\r\nA,B - rotate camera\r\nX - place blue portal\r\nY - place orange portal"

Credits to Never.\r\nNOTES:\r\nARROW KEYS: Move\r\nA \u0026 B - Rotate camera\r\nX - Place blue portal\r\nY - Place orange portal\r\n- You can only place portals in shiny metal-like surfaces.\r\n- You can place portals through bars.\r\n- You can place portals through other portals.\r\n- The glass-looking blocks are actually mirrors. You can place portals on their reflections.\r\n\r\nYou can modify and post this demo as much as you want (and I encourage you to, especially those terrible sound effects ugh!), but please consider giving me at least some credit if you do so. Enjoy ;)\r\n\r\nPlease LIKE! :)\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I've now updated the cover to be animated! :D I believe it doesn't break SURF mode, but it isn't animated either. I also added a sound for portals being successfully placed, although I am not happy with it at all :("

    "text": "Shadow Over the Twelve Lands\r\nBy Bruno Oliveira (@btco_code)\r\n\r\n** UPDATE: PDF manual is here:\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1SnYhs746W0-UF7pXWsxmwRnLmP8rE69r/view\r\n\r\nThis is a retro CRPG game where you control a party of adventurers through an epic quest that starts out with a small mistake where you essentially doom the entire world to a decade of disasters. But worry not, because you are going to fix things now and defeat the great evil you unleashed upon the world.\r\n\r\nIt's turn-based, so you have as long as you want to think things through and even in the heat of battle our monsters are well trained to wait, seemingly forever, until you have taken your turn.\r\n\r\nYou start at the shores of Riverside with barely no equipment, a laughable budget and a desire for fame, fortune and making the world a better place. Let's see how this works out for you.\r\n\r\nPrintable world map: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-9d8MZCrX5cdGBQ0LVlgSxD2lK6vp_zd\r\n\r\nThis project is open source. The source code is at:\r\nhttps://github.com/btco/so12l\r\n\r\n*** SAVEGAME WARNING: Depending on your browser, the save game feature might not work (known issue on Chrome)! To test that it's working, reload the page after the intro screen. If you see \"Save OK\" on the top left, savegames are working. In any case, if you are playing this seriously, consider downloading the cart and playing in the TIC-80 program.\r\n\r\n[ CONTROLS ]\r\n    arrow keys: move\r\n    [Z]: menu / confirm\r\n    [X]: cancel / close\r\n\r\nAt any time while adventuring you can bring up the game menu by pressing [Z] to allow you to: rest, cast spell, manage inventory and see detailed party info.\r\n\r\n[ TIPS ]\r\n0. To interact with things, just walk into them (huts, fountains, doors, etc, etc).\r\n1. To rest, use food rations: press Z to open menu, select ITEMS, select the food ration, press Z and select USE.\r\n2. Always carry plenty of food. Buy them in General Stores.\r\n3. Always carry plenty of torches to light dark caves and dungeons. Also found in General Stores.\r\n4. Upgrade equipment! You won't go very far with just a dagger and no armor.\r\n5. Save at every opportunity. Fountains and inns allow you to save.\r\n6. Beware of unidentified items. They may be cursed, explode, release poison gas, and all sorts of other bad effects. Plus, if you equip a cursed item, you won't be able to remove it.\r\n7. When you get enough XP, go to a town to train to level up. You will know you have enough XP because the XP meter on the bottom right will be highlighted with an up arrow.\r\n\r\n[ TECHNICAL DETAILS ]\r\nThe game engine is 64K of Lua code but the core of the game's logic is written in XL, an assembly-like language I created, which assembles to bytecode that gets put into the cart's Map memory banks (banks 6 and 7). You can look at the XL source code in https://github.com/btco/so12l/tree/master/xl . It looks something like this:\r\n\r\nPROC WRLD_RS_OldWizardHut\r\n TEST GM_R_MYRA; JNZ .quest_r\r\n TEST GM_C_MYRA; JNZ .quest_c\r\n SND 251 .old_wiz .quest_msg\r\n SYS SYSC_SPEAK\r\n SND 251 .old_wiz .quest_msg2\r\n SYS SYSC_SPEAK\r\n SND 0 0 .quest_narr\r\n SYS SYSC_SPEAK\r\n OR GM_A_MYRA\r\n ...\r\nEND\r\n\r\nThe assembler that takes that and converts to bytecode is in https://github.com/btco/so12l/blob/master/tools/xlasm . The VM that runs this is in https://github.com/btco/so12l/blob/master/src/xlvm.lua"

Instead of sending a number of pulses which corresponds with the number you dialed, the DTMF system uses specific sine-wave frequencies mapped to each row and column on the phone keypad. For example, pressing \"1\" causes the phone to send out a combination of 697 and 1209 Hz frequencies. The phone company then analyses these frequencies, and knows that you dialed \"1\". Pressing the keys multiple times creates a phone number, and causes the called party's phone to ring."

The ROM stored in the map is replaced with the new one.\r\n\r\nControls (QWERTY = CHIP-8):\r\n1-2-3-4 = 1-2-3-C\r\nQ-W-E-R = 4-5-6-D\r\nA-S-D-F = 7-8-9-E\r\nZ-X-C-V = A-0-B-F\r\n\r\n\r\n*** What's a CHIP-8, you might ask? ***\r\n\r\nCHIP-8 is a virtual machine standard that was originally designed for some late 70s computers, starting with the RCA COSMAC VIP kit computer. The VM could use up to 4 KB of RAM and featured rudimentary 64x32 monochrome graphics. The VM implemented a CPU with 16 8-bit general-purpose data registers, a 12-bit program counter, a call stack of at least 12 return addresses, a 12-bit pointer register, an 8-bit 60Hz timer, and access to the system buzzer. It was designed to ease game development for these COSMAC-based systems.\r\n\r\nRead more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 1, released September 25th, 2019:\r\n- Fixed an error with the CALL opcode. Dumb typos. Pong 2 hack now plays.\r\n- Prevent crashing with illegal opcode. Show a little message in the top-left corner instead.\r\n- Re-positioned the CHIP-8 screen to the center, so that it's more comfortable.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2, released September 28th, 2019:\r\n- Stack memory and framebuffer are now independent from main RAM. Fixes Tetris's graphical glitches.\r\n- Added code disassembly view at the bottom.\r\n- More fixes.\r\n\r\nUpdate 3, released November 27th, 2019:\r\n- Forgot to change the number of one of the opcodes in the disassembly view. Fixed now.\r\n\r\nUpdate 4, released August 2nd, 2020:\r\n- OVR() is now being used to upscale the CHIP-8 display area in the TIC() framebuffer, so now I can properly show the screen at 3X scale, making it more comfortable to the eyes. Most drawing API functions in OVR() won't affect the framebuffer, so it doesn't mess with the work area.\r\n- Now using format() with hex formatting, so I can display most registers in hexadecimal. Thanks to someone in Discord for helping me out, I don't understand a lot of this weird formatting stuff!\r\n- Changed the TIC-80 default beeper tone to something more old-school! Why not recreate the RCA Studio II buzzer noise?\r\n- More code optimizations.\r\n\r\nUpdate 5, released November 5th, 2024:\r\n- The screen scaling has been fixed for the latest stable version of TIC-80.\r\n- The disassembly for opcode Fx0A now reports the register about to receive the key code.\r\n- More emulator options have been added, namely scaling factor, stack top limit, and theme color.\r\n- Minor changes.\r\n\r\nUpdate 6, released December 1st, 2025:\r\n- Fixed a wraparound bug with the Ex9E and ExA1 instructions.\r\n- Minor change to the Fx33 disassembly.\r\n\r\nUpdate 7, released December 5th, 2025:\r\n- Whoops, fixed the wraparound bug with 5xy0 and 9xy0 as well.\r\n- The code size is now beautiful!"

You are no hero, just more or less ordinary human with own reason to delve into unknown. All same rules in game apply to you and NPCs. And within this you can do everything that should be possible. Easy to learn, hard to master.\r\n\r\nYou want to band with NPCs? Sure. \r\nYou want to use others and betray them at the end? Cool.\r\nYou want to hang around entrance to buy or sell stuff to others and then tell other people lies that gets them killed, because they were rude to you, so you can loot their corpses? What am I? Your mom? Do whatever you feel like it.\r\nYou want to play pacifist that try to help everyone finish their goals? Now, mom would be proud!\r\n---\r\n\r\nGame is simple now and is meant to be the starting point from which it will grow into the game I described above.\r\n\r\nYou can play the game with 3 characters, with working fighting system, there are few simple events, there is no NPCs, no perks or traits.\r\nBut game is playable from start to finish in simple scenario, for all three characters and you need to finish game with 1st to unlock 2nd and 3rd character.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know more about game and future of it, check this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/SleeplessDungeons/comments/eigzqo/what_is_sleepless_dungeons/ \r\n---\r\n\r\nWhat do you do in game: \r\n\r\n1. You choose character and enter randomly generated dungeon.\r\n2. You have map composed from encounters (cards). Where every encounter is enemy or event. You start at the top and go to the bottom.\r\n3. When you encounter new card you have to resolve what is on the card (fight enemies or experience events).\r\n3.1. Fighting with enemy is turn-based where you choose one move, enemy chooses one and then both moves are compared and effects happen. (You can interrupt/block/avoid attacks)\r\n3.2. Events can be anything from encounter with npc/enemy, for finding items/trap, place of interest etc. (Also you can look for events for anytime. Where you need to choose one of few options in how to proceed.\r\n(What events you get, what description you get and what options are avail. depends on character stats.)\r\n4. You can focus on combat, but also can play pacifist if you know game (and know how to avoid fighting).\r\n5. You can heal yourself by eating or drinking.\r\n6. You can cook when sitting by the fire. (created from main menu or found in events)\r\n7. The only things that 'matters', for completion of playthrough, is getting your goals done.\r\n8. Run is finished if you die or leave dungeon. After which you get end screen that show you bunch of stats about current game, whenever you completed your goals and your score.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Game playable only by mouse!\r\n- The characters from easiest to hardest: Bounty Hunter, Bandit, Miner.\r\n- Game will remember if you are holding weapon in two-hands or one and will not reset after the fight.\r\n- STAMINA can get below 0 and it is intended mechanic around \"FATIQUE\" and proper strategy against certain enemies.\r\n- There are few events so far so you can encounter the same one over and over\r\n- There is no music yet.\r\n---\r\n\r\nVersion 0.11 (Build 19, 24.04.2020)\r\n\r\nWhat's new in this version:\r\n-fixed: bug in gui layering system\r\n-fixed: next screen button not working in character screen when changed character few times\r\n-changed: position of player inventory when looting\r\n-changed: size of event text screen to not be behind player inventory\r\n-added: background to looting action after fight\r\n-added: tooltip to help button on fight screen\r\n---\r\n\r\nLINKS:\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL COMMUNITY: https://www.reddit.com/r/SleeplessDungeons/\r\nNATIVE VERSION AND DOWNLOADABLE HTML: https://dagondev.itch.io/sleepless-dungeons\r\nREPORT BUGS HERE: https://www.reddit.com/r/SleeplessDungeons/comments/ejfk3k/report_bugs_here/\r\nALL CHANGELOGS: https://www.reddit.com/r/SleeplessDungeons/comments/ejw5d7/changelog_can_be_found_here/\r\nMY TWITTER: https://twitter.com/dagondev"

Highest number of followers on a feature scores. In case of a tie, both players score.\r\n\r\nChurches are scored based on the number of surrounding tiles plus one. (At least 4 points, at most 9.)\r\n\r\nCities are worth 2 points per tile. Shield icons add an extra 2 points each. Cities on the edge are considered complete.\r\n\r\nRoads are worth 1 point per tile. Unlike the original game, junctions do not split roads.\r\n\r\nFarms are worth 3 points for each connected city. Unlike the original game, farms are scored when adjacent cities are all complete.\r\n\r\nYou are guaranteed to fill the board each time, because I added tiles for all possible cases. Also, you only get tiles you can place.\r\n\r\nAI 1 is dumb. It plays random valid moves.\r\n\r\nAI 2 tries to find the highest scoring opportunity, or one that gets followers back.\r\n\r\nHave fun!

Then the 3D magic happens!\r\n\r\nIf you don't understand what you're supposed to do, search it on Google because it'll probably explain it better than me.\r\n\r\nWarning! Crossing your eyes too much might make your head hurt for a while!\r\n\r\nControls:\r\nArrow keys - move the creeper head around.\r\nZ - spawn particles.\r\n\r\nNote: the \"eye\" variable in the code controls the offset distance, in 3D space, that each eye is to the middle of your head. The default is 3, which means your eyes are 6 units apart. Greater distances mean stuff appear smaller and closer to you. Negative values invert the eyes, and now require the wall-eye technique rather than cross-eye. This variant is slightly harder to do, but your head won't hurt (at least mine didn't)."

This can be used in the future to create vector graphics which takes much less space than normal sprite and can be resized without pixelating effect. Such graphics can be used in games and animations.\r\n\r\nTo create shape simply select color, shape and right click points. Shapes continuing line and polygon must be closed be double clicking last point.\r\n\r\nYou can also move points by right clicking mouse at least 5px from a point. The point then changes color to blue and can be moved where mouse cursor is while still holding right button. Release right button to end point movement. When you press shift (move point/move shape icon) once you set the mode to move the whole shape while mouse dragging.\r\n\r\nAdded gradient and pattern fill, undo, big optimalization of redrawing.\r\n\r\nAdded save and load functions. Program saves shapes encoded into string to console. To see the log create a BAT file in windows and put in there this text: tic80.exe \u003e out.txt\r\nEverytime you save the shapeData string will be put into the out.txt file. Copy it from there and whenever you want to edit your shapes put them at the first line in code where 'local shapeData' is defined.

Whenever you click or drag the mouse around, you \"fix\" the tiles. When a tile gets fixed, it assumes one of its valid forms, and updates the tiles around it. When a tile gets updated, it looks at the neighbouring tiles and changes its set of valid forms accordingly. If a tile has only one possible form, it assumes that form automatically. This way, you can't fail immediately, but if you reach a contradiction - when a tile has no possible valid forms - then you lose. A tile with no valid forms becomes invalid, and appears as a black square. It tends to corrupt its neighbours into invalid tiles as well.\r\n\r\nThis is based on the Wave Function Collapse algorithm, but manually. This cart was inspired by another cart with the same game.\r\n\r\nYou can press [Z] to reset at any time."

(Inspired by Charles R. Tanner short stories),\r\n- To successfully finish the game you must eliminate all the mosquitoes, the dogs and the shelk. Gems are optional, you ask to get 25, there are 27.\r\n- It is essential to get a weapon and learn to swim before leaving Loor, the town of Tumithak.\r\n- Ghosts are immune to gunshots and crabs are not hit. It only remains to escape from all of them.\r\n- IF YOU THINK IT IS DIFFICULT: You can avoid the fireballs of the horizontal corridors by walking without stopping at the top, in the vertical ones going up to the left and down to the right. Fixed flares and slashes don't hit you if you go through the opposite end. It is easier if you leave the collection of gems for after defeating the enemies.\r\nGood trip !!\r\n\r\nSPANISH\r\nEl planeta ha sido sometido por invasores de Venus, los shelk. La humanidad lleva siglos viviendo bajo tierra.\r\nSube a la superficie y libera a La Tierra de la invasion Shelk. (Inspirado en los relatos de Charles R.

Las gemas son opcionales, se piden 25, hay 27.\r\n- Es imprescindible tener un arma y aprender a nadar antes de salir de Loor, el pueblo de Tumithak.\r\n- Los fantasmas son inmunes a los disparos y los cangrejos no son alcanzados. Solo queda escapar de ellos.\r\n- SI TE PARECE DIFICIL: Puedes evitar las bolas de fuego de los pasillos horizontales caminando sin pararte por arriba del todo, en los verticales subiendo por la izquierda y bajando por la derecha. Las llamaradas y cuchilladas fijas no te alcanzan si pasas por el extremo opuesto. Resulta mas facil si dejas la recoleccion de gemas para despues de vencer a los enemigos.\r\nBuen viaje !!"

Later on, I have also prevented integer underflow by limiting the accuracy of the sin/cos functions."

You can use 3 skills to inflict more damage to your enemies. Each time you use a skill, there is a cool time, and if there is no cool time, you can use the skill again.\r\n\r\nAny combination of weapons and skills can be used.\r\n\r\nThere are 1 to 7 rounds, and 0 is for testing. If you select after the first round, the character's level will change. However, when selecting Round 0, the character's level does not change.\r\n\r\nAll rounds are cleared at the set time. And if there is a boss, the boss usually appears 5 seconds earlier than the clearing time, and generally does not progress while the boss is present.\r\n\r\nThe maximum level of the character is 40.\r\n\r\nIf you have a very large number of weapon markers, you will often get a lag. (Especially leveled up arrow, laser)\r\n\r\n2021/07/26 change metadata, change script type: javascript -\u003e js, support 0.90.1723,\r\nand bug fixed Changed to prevent monsters from appearing in round 3 boss battles\r\n2021/08/20 To fix a round 7 ending music bug, music output is not loop-checked.

    "text": "This cart presents some information about how to make levels through sign messages in the game (in the first level). The second level illustrates how water works, but it has no signs explaining it cause you can only use so many signs in the game.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial only makes sense if you look at level one and two in the map editor (to see what the messages in the signs in level one are referring to, and to see how water works in level two). You also have to look at the sprite editor to see the tile numbers that are mentioned in the sign messages, as well as search in the code for the things mentioned.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThree things about making 8 Bit Panda levels that did not fit in the tutorial:\r\n\r\n1) You cannot use the top 8 map pages (the top row, pages 0-7) for levels. When a level loads, it \"unpacks\" to the top 8 pages, and then \"packs\" again after it's finished. Therefore, the top 8 map pages must be left empty.\r\n2) Levels can span multiple map pages, but the entire level must be in the same map row\r\n3) You can only use three levels per isle and there can only be six isles. If you try to create a level 1-4 or 7-1, for example, it won't work.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTo learn more about 8 Bit Panda, read the original cart's comments and code.\r\nThe comments and code on this cart are the same as in the original 8 Bit Panda cart. The only differences are:\r\n\r\n1) the sign messages in the SIGN_MSGS table.\r\n2) one comment i added at the top of the code about how to access the debug menu (i didn't create the debug menu; it's in the original game).\r\n3) some indentations were deleted to make space in the code (to be able to add the sign messages and the comment).\r\n4) In TitleTic function:\r\n    -changed the colors of the title screen\r\n    -changed the name and centered the name\r\n    -removed the text at the bottom of the screen\r\n5) a couple of changes in the LVL table:\r\n    -the background colors and palettes of levels 1 and 2\r\n    -the length of levels 1, 2, and 3\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTo see the original game, made by Bruno Oliveira (btco), go here:\r\nhttps://tic80.com/play?cart=188\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAnother good thing to read is an article Oliveira wrote, which can be accessed through a link on the 8 Bit Panda github page: https://github.com/btco/panda"

In the future, when i learn how to do more than one level and get it to work, i want to implement the following:\r\n-that if you get hit once or more, you can't go on to the next level. however, you don't die. you can keep playing and the game records your best time (which goes up every time you get hit).\r\n-later, when you finish the whole game, it adds up your total time, and you can go back to each individual level to improve each time, thereby reducing the total time, so that you always have a challenge even after you finish the game, you could always get a faster time for each level and a faster total time"

Added two new enemy types. They just spawn equally randomly at the moment but the plan is to scale their damage and increase the mix as the level increases. The code isn't getting refactored until I have added a fourth enemy type and tweaked the difficulty. Then the plan is to add some powerups (mines, lasers) and some sound effects.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: Tweaked bullet damage to player. Made it take 1, 2 or 3 shots to destroy ships depending on their class. Add some basic sound effects for shooting, enemy ships blowing up, and your own inevitable death.\r\n\r\nUpdate 3: Added color to the health indicator. Added a notification system that can handle multiple simultaneous notifications, need to center the text properly. Added a probability of encountering a cloaked ship (a grey 2x2 square) which will take one shot to decloak, then the normal amount of shots to destory. You will get a notification when a cloaked ship is spawned.\r\n\r\nUpdate 4: I misunderstood how Lua handles nil so I was deleting while iterating without realising, as a consequence the game is a lot more stable. Reduced number of background stars due to feedback. Added two new enemy types. Added an Earth meter that drops every time an enemy makes it through alive, empty means game over. Next I'll add some powerups I think.\r\n\r\nUpdate 5: Changed some of the bullet dispersal patterns so they aren't always shooting in a straight line.\r\n\r\nUpdate 6: Changed more bullet patterns, added a health powerup every level. Gun updates with each of the first four levels, will probably make this powerup based, alternating barrels, double barrel, turbo fire, bullets keep travelling after collisions.\r\n\r\nUpdate 7: Minor update, had a few requests to make the stars different shades of grey to make it easier to see bullets. Fixed a bug with the powerup collision."

    "text": "A never-finished project to create a similar game to Elite for TIC-80. Please run this in the native version of TIC-80 for your operating system for optimal performance.\r\n\r\n-- CONTROLS --\r\nArrows: Pitch and yaw\r\nZ: Accept / Fire Laser\r\nX: Back / Afterburner\r\nA: Shift key - affects what other buttons do\r\nS: [Unimplemented]\r\nA+Arrows: Thrust level and yaw\r\nA+S: Open menu in flight\r\nA+Z: [Unimplemented]\r\nA+X: Jump to new system\r\nA+A: Change radar zoom level\r\n\r\nI originally began this project towards the end of 2017. Every now and then I would work a bit more on it, but since I haven't touched it in months, I figure it's about time to upload it. If you are sufficiently interested (and willing to trudge through barely-documented code), you have my permission to modify this project in any way you please. \r\n\r\nMost basic functions of Elite are implemented in the game. The AI is very rudimentary and will only dock with the station. The controls are a bit of a pain since it is based entirely on TIC's 'controller' i.e. d-pad and 4 buttons.\r\n\r\n-- FEATURES --\r\n- Full 3D\r\n- Shoot ships with lasers (they won't shoot back)\r\n- Different ship types\r\n- Procedural universe\r\n- Buy and sell cargo - you can make money from trading\r\n- Basic collisions\r\n- Autosave when docking at a station\r\n- Cheats: infinite money, change galaxy\r\n\r\n-- TECHNICAL DETAILS --\r\n\r\nThe 3d renderer uses TIC's in-built tri() and textri() functions. It is based upon a simple rule where the x and y coordinates of vertices are divided by their z coordinate, then offset and scaled to fit the screen. The renderer also has backface and (attempted) viewport culling. One issue with TIC's tri() function is that it seems to loop over pixels that are off screen, which causes lag when models are viewed at certain angles and positions. I use quaternions to store rotations using the maf library. https://github.com/bjornbytes/maf\r\n\r\nModels are stored and loaded from ram, to save code space. This was back when there was a hard limit of 64k of code. I planned to create a simple 3d modelling program but didn't get far with it, so all models were typed by hand then converted in code to the format used in ram.\r\n\r\nHit detection is done by casting a ray from the player's position. Triangles are treated as if they are perfectly aligned with the screen; the z positions of the vertices are averaged. This has no impact on lasers, but it means that you can clip into the station if you try, though you will likely take damage."

Also, there's nothing in the levels (except the ground and a gate at the end), so that you have a blank slate to start with.\r\n\r\nPlease read the comment at the top of the code for more information. Also, play the first level, which has signs with some information.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of having a lot of copies of things is that, for example, you can make water one color in one level and a different color in another level (or make enemies different colors in different levels) (without changing the entire palette for the level).\r\n\r\nThe reason i made this cart is that it takes a lot of time to make the copies of all the assets, make them work properly, and keep the whole thing organized.\r\n\r\nSo now, in the future, if people want to make levels of 8 Bit Panda with the added flexibility of having multiple copies of things, they have it all set up for them already.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFor more information about how to make levels, see the Level Maker Tutorial cart:\r\nhttps://tic80.com/play?cart=1991\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTo learn how to work with the behaviors of the enemies, see the 8BP Entity Behavior Table Tutorial cart:\r\nhttps://tic80.com/play?cart=2026\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTo see the original game, made by Bruno Oliveira (btco), go here:\r\nhttps://tic80.com/play?cart=188"

To do so you will set crosses on the field.\r\nIf you set a cross on an empty space you'll just see it. If there are already filled fields where your cross should be set, those fields are inverted. Setted tiles are cleared, unset tiles are filled.\r\n\r\nJust try it out. There's no time limit (which I wanted to implement but then discarded).\r\nIt's possible to switch between \"Levels\" and \"Random\" mode.\r\nIf you played through all 60 levels you can try the random mode which, as the name says, generate random levels. It's like a zen mode.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- puzzle game with classic graphics done in Commodore C64 color palette\r\n- completely controlled by the mouse\r\n- 60 levels included\r\n- best scores will be saved after each level\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n- clean up random tiles to keep the contrast high. some tiles are too similar to the background raster\r\n- adding music\r\n- adding best score reset\r\n- overall cleanup"

Also you can hold keys to move now! However, you can no longer press 2 keys at once to move diagonally, because was just a nightmare for map tile-based collision detection :p\r\nAlpha 1.6 - Changed healing totem textures (again).

Also added an exploding animation to the fireball and changed the healing totem texture a bit.\r\nAlpha 1.4 - Added some basic chiptune (I think) music\r\nAlpha 1.3 - Made the fireball ability do something (spawn fireballs that follow your mouse), although the fireballs spawned are permanent :p Also added a cursor and did some more back-end changes to make the game run faster (again, not that it was laggy in the first place). Plus, when you are on the same tile as a healing totem, you go \"inside\" the totem and it activates.\r\nAlpha 1.2 - Made abilities \"dim\" instead of disappearing when used, added a \"totem\" from the healing spell (that currently does nothing and can be spawned infinitely with enough time), and changed the healing spell from one-time to cooldown-based\r\nAlpha 1.1 - Abilities added (kinda, they do literally nothing right now). Also changed a few sprites and did some back-end work to clean up the code and hopefully make this run a tiny bit smoother (not that it was laggy at all in the first place but still :p)\r\nAlpha 1.0 - Added basic movement, a map, and collisions\r\n\r\nBUG TRACKER\r\n(If you find a bug not here, please put it in the comments below)\r\nKey: ? - Unknown cause, still researching | ! - Found solution, will fix soon"

This is \"Ground Attack\"\r\n\r\nYou fly a spaceship through a cave, the cave gets thinner (or will do when I actually used the level editor). There are missiles which launch at you and odd blinking things (that I could never figure out what they were supposed to be) which hinder your progress. Make sure you destroy the fuel dumps (the blue things) for extra points.\r\n\r\nUse your trusty laser with the (b) button and drop bombs with (a). Move around with the arrow keys. Don't hit anything or get hit by anything. Make your way to the end of the cave and enter the portal at the end (blue circle).\r\n\r\nI've no idea what was at the end of the original as I never got that far.\r\n\r\nI've been experimentally making a level for it.\r\n\r\nYou have 5 lives.

Doesn't have a menu yet, so you will have to configure the game through the code editor.\r\n[Story]\r\nYou have retrieved a time capsule in Mongolia containing the coordinates of an old and mysterious computer, which has been preserved in an isolated room for generations to come, in an abandoned base.\r\nIt contains a training program seemingly used for an unknown type of war craft, probably a remotely controlled plane.\r\nThe computer is connected to a database, containing the data of hostile alien crafts humanity encountered and vainquished.\r\nYou decide to try out the program...\r\n[How to play]\r\nControls: mouse (1 button) or touchscreen (mouse is better though)\r\nClick to switch between shot modes.\r\nDash and click to aim your shots.\r\nFiring is automatic, unless you're using the Search type craft which won't aim unless an enemy is in sight.\r\nSome ships do a special action when double-clicking.\r\nAiming Orientation:\r\n- Evasive: your shots will be aimed away from the direction you dashed in.\r\n- Aggressive: your shots will be aimed towards the direction you dashed in.\r\nPlayable ships:\r\nBomber: three shot modes and a bomb which charges over time. It has 3 levels of charging which increase the radius and duration of the explosion.\r\nMobile: option which can switch between straight shot and wide shot, it can be launched and retrieved.\r\nFollowing: Gradius-like options which can either follow you or move along you. They tilt based on your Aiming Orientation.\r\nSearch: 7 options which automatically search enemies. While following you, they can either aim enemies everywhere or in a small angle. You can put them in a stationary state, but their attack range will become smaller.\r\nYin-Yang: Switch between a weak shot with a shield which slows down bullets and destroys some of them (Yin mode), and a strong but not very protective shot (Yang mode). You can launch a charged weapon when switching between modes.\r\nCurvybeam: straight curved laser, back laser which homes in on the lowest enemy onscreen, two rings, squid-shaped pattern and powerful blade aimed accordingly to your movements. Not suited for beginners.\r\nWarp: can teleport everywhere when the teleportation gauge is full. It fills up when grazing enemy bullets. After teleporting, a dummy is created at your position before teleportation. Enemies will aim at it instead of your craft.\r\nOther shot types will be added later.\r\nAiming algorithm (Search):\r\n- Protector: nearest enemy (suited for beginners)\r\n- Killer: weakest enemy\r\n- Greedy: enemy with the best score/HP ratio (better for scoreplayers)\r\n[Mechanics]\r\nThere are four rank values, called Karma, indicated by the bars on the left of the screen. The three first ones from left to right are called Front, Side and Back. They alter the bullet patterns launched respectively downwards, sideways and upwards. They increase when killing enemies above you, on the sides, and below you. Some enemies are worth more Karma than others. The last Karma value slowly increases with time.\r\nGrazing bullets gives points, but staying near the same bullet gives even more points. This also increases the Zorig (indicated by blue Z), which increases the score by 6*zorig every frame. Grazing bullets at pointblank fills the Zorig gauge faster than normal grazing. If you die, the Zorig will be reset to 0, and your rank will be divided by 2. While invincible, you won't be rewarded from grazing, except if that invincibility time comes from filling the Xuch gauge (indicated by orange X).\r\nKilling enemies fill the Xuch gauge. Once it's full, it will give you some invincibility time and start emptying while doubling your firepower.\r\n[Edits]\r\n19/10/2022: nerfed one of Örgönjigüür's bullet patterns.\r\n23/10/2022: fixed the \"end of stage message being shown while the game over message is being displayed\" bug."

Changed method for camera scrolling (you don't have to hug the sides anymore).\r\nHold mouse button for manual, high range and slow lock-on attack. Release to launch missiles on locked enemies. Click+hold mouse button for automatic, low range and fast lock-on attack. It tries to find an enemy to lock, and launches missiles once it doesn't find anything to attack. An enemy can't be locked more than 1 time. The enemies nearest to the player are locked first.\r\nAlso slight modifications to the scoring system."

They options shoot both regular bullets and piercing lasers. The options can switch between three formations: concentrated, wide and ultra-wide. Dash+clicking adjusts their shooting angle, like the Mobile shot type. Dash+double-clicking throws the options, putting them in a special stationary state where they form a triangle pattern and generate a powerful bullet slowdown field.\r\nSome enemy attack patterns have been slightly modified. The enemy hitboxes' shape have been modified (formerly squares, now circles).\r\nSlightly modified the scoring \u0026 Zorig systems. Every 10 Zorig levels, you get 12 points each frame. Made the Bomber type's bomb more powerful.\r\nAdded a configuration menu so that you can customize your experience to your heart's content!

I'm honest I joined TIC-80 Community in March 2019.\r\nI remember for the first time back in September 2017 we looked for the google play store and there are found the \"TIC-80\" app I checked some cool 80s terminal styles from TIC-80's old 0.10 version screenshots so I don't want to install it.\r\n\r\nAnd, Again remember that... In October 2018 I looked for the \"TIC-80\" app on the google play store (again) and I installed it. Let's look to open this \"TIC-80\" app that feels like a fan-made computer.\r\n\r\nThat's it.\r\n\r\nSTORY:\r\nI logged in to my old Google account and I found the TIC-80 folder stuff\r\n(including older cartridges backup, todos, etc) from October 2018 to 2022 on google drive.\r\nI finally found the \"Move play.tic\" cart file on my TIC-80 drive stuff and I did run my very first 2018's cart it seems simply interesting (most likely sourced from the hello world default old demo) via TIC-80 Application.\r\n\r\nThe End.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis \"Move play.tic\" cartridge file was made/compiled on ‎31 ‎October ‎2018.\r\n\r\nI remember correctly some details (written in my memory):\r\nSource Found: My Old Google Drive Stuff\r\nCartridge Public Type: Lost (Found?, Archived), It's probably very old.\r\nMade on: Samsung Galaxy Tab (R.I.P 2017-Mid 2019) and TIC-80 Version: 0.70.7 (0.70.6)\r\n\r\n(C) 2019-2023 Master Nama"

    "text": "Updates:\r\n• Revised music and arranged boss theme.\r\n• Added XIIMORI TEMPERAMENT feature. You can choose between Bolgoomjtoy and Aymshiggüi. Bolgoomjtoy gives automatic protection and attenuates the consequences of shipdamage (Karma and Zorig loss) if Xüch gauge is over 50%, however the graze field is smaller and the Xüch power boost gives a shorter invincibility time and lasts less time. Aymshiggüi, on the other hand, doesn't have any protection, but grants a larger graze field and better Xüch power boosts in terms of invincibility and effect duration.\r\n• Modified and lengthened the stage by adding a ~52 second loop that advances as you destroy all enemies onscreen. This loop has two different routes. If your Zorig is equal to or exceeds 5/7/9 (depends on difficulty mode), you will take the harder route, which also is better for scoring, otherwise you will take the easier and less profitable one.\r\n• Örgönjigüür's central part is now twice as resistant to bullets during its first phase.\r\n• P to pause the game.\r\n• Added high score table and replay feature.\r\nNote: due to the limitations of TIC-80, you have to use the key combination Ctrl+S or enter the command \"save\" in the console in order to preserve the high scores. Given that you can't save a cart on browser, you may want to download the cart file if you want the high score table to be usable.\r\n• Added two shot types: Targeting and Hexamethodic (abbreviated to Hexamethod.).\r\nTargeting type: your ship has five options that shoot at a reticle you can aim by holding the mouse button and moving your ship at the same time. Double-clicking switches the option formation between following your ship and orbiting around the reticle.\r\nHexamethodic type: dashing and double-clicking in a specific direction unleashes a special attack that uses a gauge replenished upon damaging enemies with your ship's regular shots. Varying on the direction you dashed towards, different weapons can be used:\r\n• List of attacks (Evasive aiming orientation)\r\nUp: 3-way explosive lightballs\r\nDiagonal up: activates an option ship that shoots in several ways downwards\r\nSides: two swords, devastating against weak enemies\r\nDiagonal down: activates 5 option ships that shoot in the same direction upwards\r\nDown: powerful piercing beam\r\nNo dash+double-click: small force field\r\n• Made Hybrid type's concentrated formation a bit stronger.\r\n• The entire screen flashes white when the player ship is destroyed.\r\n• Also solved some bugs."

Then you can save it to the sprite/tiles page with a custom size - max (128x128) After saving, you can use the export console command to export the saved sprites as a .png for use outside of TIC-80.

You’ll need your special talent to fit into - and ultimately sit in - a series of cardboard boxes. You’ll walk across the screen and at any time have the option to halt each half of your body. To fit in the box, your chest and butt must be within the edges of the box. If any pixel of your chest or butt is outside the edges of the box when your front and hind ends stop moving… you lose! But if you fit in the box, you get points for the sit and move on to the next!\r\n\r\nPrecision is rewarded.

IMPORTANT !\r\nI have found an oversight in my theme where replacing \".local/[version]/config.tic\" with this theme doesn't replace colour numbers used by the code editor even when editing afterward, which may be to the user's dismay. I didn't warn the user about backing up the \"config\" file for no reason, unless the user wishes to use the \"config reset\" command.\r\nSo here's how to apply the theme without breaking the code editor colours:\r\n1. Copy the CODE parameters from \"mypkaxmas.tic\" to the \"config\" cart.\r\n2. Enter the following commands while the \"config\" file is loaded (you can enter them in any order):\r\n\"load mypkaxmas.tic tiles\", \"load mypkaxmas.tic sprites\", \"load mypkaxmas.tic map\", \"load mypkaxmas.tic sfx\", \"load mypkaxmas.tic palette\"\r\n3.

    "text": "You play as Aang. The Western Air Temple has been overrun by normally-benevolent spirits, hungry for the cosmic energy of the Avatar. You must navigate the temple and relight all 31 Spirit Lanterns by hand with your firebending. In addition, you can satiate spirits by hitting them with fire (X button), or slow them with water (S button). You can also levitate with your air bending (A button). This is useful, as if you get too close to an unsatiated spirit, it will drain you (you will die and respawn at the last Spirit Lantern). You can only take so many drainings (5 lives) before you must rest and attempt to re-light the Lanterns (you will respawn at the beginning of the level). However, particularly in areas where there are many spirits, you can bend a shield around yourself (Z Button) to temporarily prevent spirits from draining you. \r\n\r\nThe following is a brief tutorial and explanation of the more difficult mechanics. \r\n\r\nUse the arrow keys to navigate through the world, using A to fly. Be careful when flying to avoid the spirits floating in the air, even close to the ground. Hopping and giving them fire energy will calm them. Your other elemental abilities work as follows: Z gives you a three second earth shield. This is very important later in the game to drop into areas full of spirits. X shoots out bits of fire that feed spirits, pacifying them. Water calms them so that they stop moving, but will still drain you if you get too close. In addition, note that if you are standing at a lit Spirit Lantern, you will not be drained, making them safe havens, even in seas of spirits. This is also useful as you must watch your ‘element meters’ in the bottom left. Should you run out of air power, your flight will stutter. Spam X or S, and you will run out of fire and water, and be left with no way to calm the spirits. Be drained, and you respawn at the last spirit lantern. \r\n\r\nNavigate through the world, and light all the spirit lanterns. Should you later return to an area with lit lanterns, the spirits will no longer be there. Here are some other tips. At the surface level, be careful not to fly off the top of the screen. This will result in losing a life. Use the beginning, without spirits, to practice the flow of using your elements. \r\n\r\nNote: (Should you come to a new area with unlit lanterns and no spirits, try leaving where you came from, and re-entering. This may mean you accidentally did not pass over the barrier required to trigger spirit spawning. This may occur as you move from the surface down below the cliffs. It is best to stay near the platforms of the Air Temple). "

Fixed the bug with losing lives and not resetting missiles.\r\n2. Reduced the maximum number of bullets from 5 to 4\r\n3. Slowed down the player bullet speed form 2 to 0.75\r\n4. Aliens can now shoot up to 30 missiles at you, beware.\r\n5. Alien missile speed now range randomly from 0.3 to 0.5\r\n\r\nV1.2:\r\n1. Aliens now have hitpoints, the two top rows have 3 hitpoints, the two middle rows have 2 hitpoints and the bottom rows have two hitpoints. I felt this better justifies their different score values.\r\n2. Player damage for each bullet is now 1, in the future I might add some mechanics which may increase or decrease this value.\r\n3. To compensate for the increased difficulty, I have increased the player lives form 4 to 5.\r\n4. Players now have highscores and, if they so desire they may save those highscores by pressing the END button int heir keyboards so this score is stored in the persistent storage.\r\n5. The saved hgihscore is now automatically loaded at gamestart.\r\n6. Aliens nwo have bars which reflect explicitly their current hitpoints.\r\n7. Removed the timer dipslay because I ran out of screen space and the highscore is more important, I may add it back later, but the code is preserved and the timer is still running in the background.\r\n\r\n1.1a:\r\n1. Change the save key from END to F1 because it was causing issues when playing from the web.\r\nBugs:\r\n1. Sometimes, when the player loses a life, the wait time before the game continues is inconsistent. Sometimes There is no wait time and sometimes it drags on for seconds. (FIXED)\r\n\r\nPlease report any bugs you find.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n1. Make a simple main menu to let the player select the difficulty of the game and customize a few aspects of it.\r\n2. Add a highscore system separated by difficulty level.\r\n3. Implement a hitpoint system for each alien, justifying the better scoring when  some of the aliens are killed, maybe I could let them have different behaviors as well.\r\n4. Implement the player shields.\r\n4. Every time the player clears a level (kills all the aliens), he may be able to buy upgrades, lives and repair the shields, adding a sense of progression, obviously the aliens should become harder to compensate. The currency will be the player score, so the less the player buys upgrades the better his score.\r\n5. Implementing a pause menu\r\n6. Balance the game, the player bullets are too fast, also the aliens are shooting too many missiles at you.\r\n\r\nThese are more advanced features that I'm not really sure can be done in TIC80:\r\n\r\n6. Implementing data persistence for highscores and game configurations.\r\n7. Add the option to save and load games (I have no diea how I can do that in tic80)"

Read further for details.\r\n---\r\n1. Plot\r\n2. Basics: gameplay\r\n3. Basics: screens\r\n4. Battle screen in more detail\r\n5. Changing controls\r\n6. Bit of FAQ\r\n\r\n1. Plot\r\nRedorose is country with mighty king powered by magic sword which was stolen recently.\r\nAs one of rebels you was caught but were provided a chance to get away from punishment:\r\njust find magic sword and bring it into king palace. Easy, right?\r\n2. Gameplay\r\nThis section will explain basics of what you have to do.\r\nIn your hands is minimap which will help in many things: navigate world,\r\nbetter find items on soil, see active tiles, and many more.\r\nYou may encounter bad boys, you can visit shops and talk with people,\r\nand pick up some things or use them. Use all of these to get closer to your goal.\r\n3. Screens\r\nGame divided in many screens:\r\n- Start menu: allows you to choose some starting conditions and read plot.\r\nOn this screen use up and down to choose option, left and right to change values,\r\nand press buttons shown on screen to choose one of two presets or start game.\r\n- Exploration: here you can see buttons when actions are possible:\r\nAttract enemy\r\nEnter screen with stats or interior/dialogue if you stand on certain tiles\r\n(If you have map) unfold it and look at world in more detail\r\n- Battle: if you have bad luck or big balls you fight with foe and either die or die.\r\n- Map: use arrows to look around it and see what exactly is where exactly.\r\n- Stats: not just stats, but also gold, scraps, your hp, and items you have.\r\nGold used for buying items, scraps used for crafting, \r\nMANA IS RECOVERABLE AND USABLE ONLY IN FIGHT, GETTING DEPLETED WHEN YOU FINISH BATTLE,\r\nand here some information about stats:\r\n\r\nStrength: affects chance for critical (x3 damage) hit with weapon and power of hands\r\nWith 0, you will have ~10% chance to do critical hit\r\nWith 999, you will have ~40% chance to do critical hit\r\n\r\nSpeed: affects chance to avoid being hit (affects only regular attacks)\r\nWith 0, you will have 0% chance to avoid hit\r\nWith 999, you will have ~50% chance to avoid hit\r\n\r\nWeaponry: affects chance to hit while using weapon\r\nWith 0, you will have ~30% chance to hit\r\nWith 999, you will have ~77% chance to hit\r\n\r\nMind: affects variety of magic you may use\r\n\r\nCrafting: affects variety of things you can make in crafthouses\r\n\r\nPositivity: affects your movement speed in overworld\r\n\r\n4. Battle screen details\r\nThis screen is flooded with numbers and no controls, so read this section for info\r\nAt top you can see foe name, hp, damage, and turn number\r\nYou use each hand in combat separately which gives you 2 sub-turns when it's your turn.\r\nIn middle you can see \"...\" which stands for no info, or string with information about\r\nsome events (special attack of enemy, news about avoiding attack, etc), your foe\r\nBottom part is most interesting, let's divide it into 3 parts:\r\n- Left bottom part is your magic list, here you can see spell name, mana and wisdom\r\nvalues you have and requirements, and description for spells. Press X and Y buttons\r\nto change spells and press B to use spell.\r\n- Middle bottom part is your inventory of usable items (YOU CAN USE THESE ITEMS ONLY DURING BATTLE)\r\nYour very first item is hands which does small damage, which can be upgraded by upgrading Strength,\r\nand does damage with 100% hit chance. All other items are not endless in usage and either one-use only\r\n(Consumables) or multiple-use (Weapons).\r\nThis section shows on which item in list you are, and overall amount of items; Name of item and its effect\r\nTo change items press left or right and press A to use item.\r\n- Right bottom part shows your stats, hp, mana, gold and scraps\r\nRemember that MANA GETS RESET TO 0 WHEN YOU FINISH FIGHT, MAKE YOUR STRATEGY AROUND THIS FACT.\r\n5. Changing controls\r\nRemember that buttons listed here refers to TIC-80 buttons, not their keyboard \"emulation\" (think about\r\nTIC-80 as emulator, where you have to simulate gamepad buttons through keyboard buttons)\r\nThis is default mapping (TIC-80 buttton=keyboard buttons)\r\nUp, down, left, right=arrows\r\nA=Z\r\nB=X\r\nX=A\r\nY=S\r\nIf you find this binding confusing or uncomfortable, which is understandable, you can configure them!\r\nHere instructions:\r\n- Press ESC during gameplay. You'll get to menu with grey net in background, link at bottom and\r\nname of engine at top. In future use mouse click or arrows+ENTER to choose menu options.\r\n- Choose in this sequence: OPTIONS; SETUP GAMEPAD\r\n- Choose button you wish to change, then press new keyboard binding\r\n- Repeat until all bindings are what you need\r\n- Choose in this order: SAVE MAPPING; BACK; RESUME GAME.\r\n\r\nYou can also play using gamepad, just plug it before play. Notice that buttons are mapped\r\nautomatically to face buttons and you can't change them, experiment to see which buttons do what.\r\n6. FAQ\r\n- Why I loose stats or even gold/etc during some battles?\r\n- This can be effect of special attack.\r\n\r\n- Why tiles such as items, characters, shops are not displayed in overworld? I can't see them.\r\n- They are functional, they're just invincible as effect of limited raycast. I tried to place interactable \r\ntiles such way that you can step on them\r\nby using walls, automap, or there just too many of tiles to miss interaction.\r\nHovewer, some items may appear in empty land without clear\r\nlandmarks, in this case you have to walk around a bit and use automap.\r\n\r\n- How minimap works?\r\n- White pixel in center is you. Other solid colors are walls, and flashing colors are active tiles.\r\n\r\n- What's with FOV and fish eye?\r\n- Main hero is fishman. FOV is just equal to TIC-80 resolution (240 degrees), thanks to my dumb coding.\r\n\r\n- What do I do in game?\r\n- Explore the world. I tried to explain most important things, leaving quests to your play. If you are\r\nreally lost - I can write playthrough file.\r\n\r\n- I entered tile, but it shows black screen.\r\n- I think this might be bug where you stand too close to wall, and game thinks that you \"enter\" wall tile,\r\nmeaning no impact. Just quit screen, step back a bit and try again.\r\n\r\n- Why resurrecting at preacher leaves enemies the same as when you died, not corresponding to preacher's zone danger level?\r\n- Bug.\r\n\r\n- How do I save?\r\n- There no saves :(\r\n\r\n- What day-night cycle affects? Maybe work time of shops, or variety of enemies?\r\n- Nothing. I had plans on making main quest limited by time, but decided to not make balancing work harder.\r\n\r\n- I found bug or have suggestion.\r\n- I don't think I will add content to game in major way, but if there is bad bug I will fix it. Just leave comment\r\nin game's itch.io page.\r\n\r\n- How bad is your code?\r\n- REALLY BAD. DON'T LOOK AT IT."

    "text": "A cart that implements a few functions for a raytraced light rendering system all within a remap function that can be easily implemented and used. Supports directional lights and all parameters of a light can be changed at runtime.\r\n\r\nLil' Tutorial :\r\n\r\nStep 1 - Setup\r\nFind the variable named \"SOLID_FLAG\" and set it to the flag you use to identify solid tiles\r\nFind the variable named \"FLAG_SET\" and set it to true if solid tiles have the flag set otherwise set it to false\r\nFind tha variable named \"BLANK_TILE\" and set it to a blank tile that you have, alternatively if you want your darkness to have a texture you can set this var to the tile ID you want\r\n\r\nStep 2 - Using LighTic\r\nFind your map() call and then set the last input, the ninth input, to the function \"light\"\r\n\r\nDone, that's it, you can now simply use map() and all tiles will be shown/hidden based on the various lights.\r\n\r\nNow if you want to enable smooth ligthing there are a few more steps to do :\r\nDISCLAIMER : Using smooth ligting currently comes at a very steep performance cost, I'm currently working on some optimizations\r\n\r\nFind the variable named \"SMOOTH_LIGHT\" and set it to true\r\nTo use the smooth lighting youmust allocate some unsudet sprites to the function, to do that find the table called \"FREE\" and add as many sprite IDs as you want, it is recommended to use about 3 per different tile\r\nAnd finally before calling the map function write \"firstTile=true\" one line before\r\n\r\nDone! Now you have smooth ligthing.\r\n\r\nHow to add a light to the scene :\r\nJust call NewLight().\r\n\r\nThe inputs are strength, angle, cone, x position, y position\r\nExplanations :\r\n\r\nstrength : the max range of the light, anithing further won't be illuminated\r\nangle : used for directional lights, it indicates the direction of the light\r\ncone : The spred of the light, set it to 180° to make a circular light light\r\nx position : the x position of the light\r\ny position : the y position of the light\r\n\r\nThe function return a reference to a light wich gives you full access of all it's propreties, they are :\r\n\r\nx : the x position\r\ny : the y position\r\nstr : the strength of the light\r\nisActive : if the light is on or not\r\nang : the angle of the light\r\ncone : the spread of the light\r\n\r\nA feature that can be useful are the new \"light masks\", basically a light for lghts.\r\nThey basically let tiles light up only if they're in their range and line of sight.\r\n\r\nTo instatiate a mask you call \"NewMask\", the inputs are the same as the ones for \"NewLight\".\r\nMasks come at a little performance cost but in my tests it's only about 1-2ms for 1 mask\r\n\r\nThis cart also includes 5 helper functions :\r\n\r\nrad2deg : helper function to convert radians to degrees\r\ndeg2rad : helper function to cenvert degrees to radians\r\nraycast : given two positions casts a ray from the forst twards the second, returns false if the ray hits something on the way there, otherwise returns true\r\nreadSpr : given a sprite ID it return a table containing the pixels\r\nsaveSpr : given a table of pixels and an ID saves the pixels in the ID"

Only channel 33 does anything right now.\r\n\r\n# Controls:\r\n[Z] Interact\r\n[X] Cancel\r\n[Arrow Keys] Move\r\n\r\n# Okay, what exactly is this?!?\r\nAn unfinished homage to a deleted TIC80 game that only existed for like a week. In the original you were locked in a room and forced to browse 99 TV channels at random. Once you selected a channel, you had to walk to bed (very slowly) and go to sleep. In your dreams you would enter small levels (varying based on the TV channel) which occasionally contained collectible items: A key, a flower, a crucifix, etc. When you collected all 5 of them, you were rewarded with an ending scene (complete with dialogue) that made more or less exactly zero sense.\r\n\r\nSince the game was so opaque, I wasn't even able to complete it legit: I cheated, peeked at the code and noted down the 5/99 channels that actually did anything, along with the order they had to be accessed in, then beat the game. But the ending mystified me: I got the sense that it was something incredibly personal and meaningful to the gamedev that was impossible for anyone else to understand. After a week of ruminating, I decided to take a second look to see if I could make heads or tails of it, but the game had been deleted: It would remain a mystery forever.\r\n\r\nWho could have made that weird TV-based Yume Nikki fangame? Why did they do it? Who were the characters, and why did only 2 of them get dialogue? What did the ending mean? None of the 3 people who played the cart would ever know. It's possible that I am the only person who even saw the game's ending aside from the author.\r\n\r\nAt the time it was published, most TIC80 games lacked the polish of today's catalog so the mere fact that it had a proper ending was enough to differentiate it from other entries on the RECENT GAMES list. Sure, the actual game was pretty bad: the movement system approached Atari 2600 levels of kludginess, the core game loop was as fun as guessing a bike lock combination, and the graphics were not good, but the EXPERIENCE stuck.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I spent about 2 afternoons starting a slightly more polished clone before abandoning it. I really don't know what I was thinking. It's been gathering digital dust for about 4 years by now and I didn't have it backed up anywhere so I just decided to upload it as is."

Your choices determine Duke's fate—escape or accept the endless cycle of the sewers.\r\n\r\n# Scoring System:\r\n. +10 points for each step forward.\r\n. +100 points for each fragment collected.\r\n. +500 points for collecting all 5 fragments throughout the levels.\r\n. +150 points for collecting \"Essence of Poop\" bonuses.\r\n. Bonus points based on remaining time *10 (per second).\r\n. Endgame Portals: After completing all rooms, players must choose between two portals:\r\n\r\n# Prestige System and Portals room:\r\n. The Prestige Portal (Purple): Face faster enemies and earn more points in a new game cycle.\r\n. The Transcendence Portal (Blue): Only accessible if you’ve collected all 5 fragments, leading Duke to transcend the sewer and \"win\" the game.\r\n\r\nPrestige mode offers a replay with increased difficulty but allows for higher scores, while completing the game through the Transcendence Portal offers a definitive ending.\r\n\r\n# Controls: Move Duke using arrow keys.\r\n\r\nTest your reflexes, collect fragments, and decide Duke's fate in this fast-paced arcade-style adventure.\r\n\r\n/!\\ Please note : This project is still under development, so the UI and sound design are a bit basic (inexistant for the sound part).\r\n\r\nStay tuned for updates!"

This effect can be toggled on and off via the system menu.\r\n\r\nPlacing fences:\r\nTo place a new fence, move the pointer between 2 free posts and press the gamepad button or left-mouse button, the fence will be built.

It's not much, but it's the first time I did more than change the sprites of the Hello World program. The music defaults to track 1, but you can switch to track 2 or turn off the music entirely. If you would like to reset your high score, you can do so by exiting the cart and going to the editor and setting hsc_r to 1. Once the high score has been reset, you must set hsc_r back to 0 to continue playing the game. I can't take much credit for this game, though, as the base game code for the player, enemies, and hit detection were created by ChatGPT via a prompt to make a simple TIC-80 game in Lua. If i had more knowledge about making TIC-80 games in Lua, I probably could have done the whole thing on my own, but I don't know nearly as much about TIC-80 Lua than I do Commodore 64 BASIC. I can't be credited for the music either, since I used the music from the TIC-80 demo music.tic, created by nesbox. Track 1 is just a blatent copy, and track 2 is a \"remix\" of sorts. I like to think that each track represents your \"gaming mood\" (yes, I know, sounds cringe). Track 1 = Going for a new world record, and track 2 = just playing 'cause why not? The only things that I myself did were modifying some of ChatGPT's code, making sprites/tiles, and modifying nesbox's music.

    "text": "Top-down racing game based on SRB2Kart\r\n\r\nControls (on TIC-80 gamepad, check \"setup gamepad\" in TIC-80 options to see keyboard binds):\r\nA - Accelerate\r\nB - Drift\r\nX - Brake/drive backwards\r\nY - Use item\r\nLeft/Right - Steering\r\nUp/Down - Item aiming, some items behave differently depending on it, bananas can be thrown forward for example\r\n\r\nAlso you can enable auto acceleration in settings, might be helpful on phones. You'd still need to time accel button press for start boost tho\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\n\r\n* 2025-06-26\r\n- New map: Lava Reef\r\n- Attempt to fix bots \"giving up\" sometimes\r\n- Bots now have a small \"pity\" boost if drifting is disabled on map, to compensate that\r\n\r\n* 2025-06-27\r\n- New map: Verdant Ruins Zone\r\n- All other maps now have \"Zone\" in name too\r\n- Fixed intermission highlight color being wrong (skincolor index was used instead of actual palette index)\r\n\r\n* 2025-06-29\r\n- Add unlockable \"Hell Maps\"! To unlock them, you need to get record attack medals on all non-hell maps. There are no exact plans for hell maps yet but they are supposed to be maps with gameplay that slightly differs from regular maps\r\n- New hell map: ??? (Inspired by same map in SRB2Kart by Spee)\r\n- Some parts of object and checkpoint code now support map wrapping around, was implemented for the new map\r\n\r\n* 2025-07-02\r\n- Initial music support (rn there's only 1 track for green hills. Music is disabled by default, can be enabled in settings. Enabling it will reserve 2 out of 4 sound channels for music)\r\n- New map: Egg Rock Zone (from SRB2)\r\n- New hell map: ??? (from DRRR)\r\n\r\n* 2025-07-05\r\n- Added character icons, which are displayed in intermission and mini-rankings. Thanks bhgdev for suggestion!\r\n- Mini-rankings allowed to notice an oversight in checkpoint system, which caused item roulette to roll wrong items sometimes (catch-up items for 1st for example). This is fixed now\r\n\r\n* 2025-07-08\r\n- Last place in match race now gets eliminated, with effect similar to explosion in ring racers. Also in general, all explosions now have a sound\r\n- Rubberbanding for bots gets weaker near end of race, to avoid situations where they overtake you with rubberband boost without a chance to catch up\r\n- Using \"RETRY\" option in game menu now does a quicker \"fade\"\r\n- Improvements to music system, added tracks (WIP) for main menu, intermission/level select (they share 1 track), and one of hell maps, tho music remains (and probably will remain) disabled by default\r\n- Function for drawing rotated sprites has been optimized, now it doesn't create bunch of matrices each time its called which should improve performance (hopefully should fix occasional stutters, which i personally been getting sometimes)\r\n\r\n* 2025-07-09\r\nI don't think i'll be updating game much more, for some time at least, so this is somewhat release update!\r\n- Buffed bot rubberbanding at last lap back a little, so they don't slow down too much especially on hard difficulty (now rubberbanding can get reduced at most to 25% of its strength, used to be 0%)\r\n- Bots are now bit smarter in terms of using items - on hard difficulty they will throw bananas and eggboxes forward if player is in front, or throw orbinauts backwards when player is behind. Also, they throw orbi's backward on all difficulties if they're in 1st place (since it makes no sense to throw them forward in 1st anyway)\r\n- All maps now have \"recommended\" bot list, so that they are more challenging (so for example on maps with a lot of turns you won't get sonic or metal sonic as opponents)\r\n- With all that, match race now has medals to win! Silver medal for 2nd/1st place on normal/hard difficulty, gold medal for 1st place on normal/hard, and platinum medal for 1st place on hard difficulty (currently, they don't do anything, maybe will add more unlockables for them at some point)\r\n- Item box respawn time has been reduced from 5 seconds to 1 (skipping them is too annoying and may be unforgiving if you are in last place)\r\n- Added spinout indication for minirankings (inspired by MiniRankingsPlus SRB2Kart mod)\r\n- Added new music track for Sunny Islands Zone, also changed menu theme a bit\r\n- Added proper scrolling credits :3"

What people don't know, and what you can't explain to them, is that every night as the sun sets, otherworldly horrors descend on the city and threaten to devour it. Only your Musick can hold them back.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, arrow keys/D-pad and the Z/X/A/S keys or A, B, X, and Y buttons play notes from different parts of your musical staff which rise up to repel the intruding hellspawn. \r\n\r\nDuring the day, left/right moves you through your room, the Z key or A button interacts with things, and the X key or B button pauses. You can sleep in your bed to regain stamina, practice music at your music rack or read books at your bookshelf to gain experience, or go to the door to head to town.\r\n\r\nYou will receive messages throughout the day alerting you when different shops will be open. The Repair Shop is open in the morning so you can repair broken strings or upgrade your violin. The bookstore will be open in the afternoon so you can buy new books, each with their own upgrade from studying, and the Orchestra will be open at night so you can play to make money.\r\n\r\nPlease check out the itch.io release to download the supplemental files! The game comes with an instruction manual, a list showing the implemented mechanics and the planned future updates, the game design document, and the short story \"The Music of Erich Zann\" by HP Lovecraft on which it was based. \r\nYou can find that here: https://the-wizards-tales.itch.io/themusick"
